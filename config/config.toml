# [!] Warning [!] This is an example configuration file. It is not intended to be used as is.

# The configuration file primarily serves two functions:
# 1. Set up the equipment list.
# 2. Define filtering conditions.
# The tool will traverse all possible equipment combinations, check if their attribute points are valid, and store valid builds in the database.
# If the generation process is slow or results in numerous builds with inadequate attributes, filtering conditions can be applied.
